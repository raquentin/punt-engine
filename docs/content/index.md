This site hosts documentation on [punt-engine](https://github.com/raquentin/punt-engine), a high-frequency trading engine build for FPGAs and maintained by [Trading @ Georgia Tech](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tradingclubgt/posts/?feedView=all).

## Objective

This project is maintained by undergraduates. We use a $200 FPGA and have no bankroll. The main goal here is to build some of the first well-documented open source software in this genre.

## Overview
See [[notes/the-punt-engine-system|The Punt Engine system]].

## Contributing

All contributors are welcome. Begin by reading some of this site and looking through [open issues tagged "help wanted"](https://github.com/raquentin/punt-engine/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).

Many modules within our monorepo have dedicated pages here listing dependencies and local dev instructions, find them using the search bar.

There will inevitably be holes in the docs. If you have questions or want guidance, we hold office hours in [our Discord](https://discord.gg/2A2dpwfxBF).

You can direct other questions to race@raquent.in.

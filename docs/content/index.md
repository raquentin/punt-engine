This site hosts documentation on [punt-engine](https://github.com/raquentin/punt-engine), a high-frequency trading engine build for FPGAs and maintained by [Trading @ Georgia Tech](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tradingclubgt/posts/?feedView=all).

## Objective

As a team of undergraduates on a $200 FPGA with a bankroll stimmed largely by microstakes poker winnings, we can safely attribute any profits generated from this infrastructure to good fortune. A better goal here is to build some of the first well-documented open source software in this genre.

## Contributing

All contributors are welcome. Begin by reading some of this site and looking through [open issues tagged "help wanted"](https://github.com/raquentin/punt-engine/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).

Many modules within our monorepo have dedicated pages here listing dependencies and local dev instructions, find them using the search bar.

There will inevitably be holes in the docs. If you have questions or want guidance, we hold office hours in [our Discord](https://discord.gg/2A2dpwfxBF) on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday from 9:30am to 12:00pm EDT/UTC-4.

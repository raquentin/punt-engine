Punt Engine is an open-source FPGA-accelerated high-frequency trading engine. See https://punt-engine.com for full documentation.

## Components

### Pipebomb
**P**ipebomb **I**s a **P**ipelined and **E**ventually **B**alanced **O**rder-**M**anaging **B**ook.
In short, it's a discrete hardware core inputting a stream from Nasdaqâ€™s ITCH protocol and outputting market indicators that drive strategic decisions.

### Madlib
**M**adlib: **A** **D**MA **L**ibrary via **I**nterconnect **B**uffers. It abstracts upon the [Xilinx PCIe DMA drivers](https://github.com/Xilinx/dma_ip_drivers) to provide a C++ programming interface for writing to and reading from FPGA on-board memory.
